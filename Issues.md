### Q&A

If you have any questions, please create an
[issue](https://github.com/KAIST-IS521/2017-Spring/issues).
When an issue is opened, course staffs will mark the issue with an appropriate
label based on its contents.

When describing your problem, it is always a good idea to use Markdown
references to pinpoint your commit and line numbers (if you are dealing with
public repository). See
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23821235/how-to-link-to-specific-line-number-on-github
for more information.

##### Before Asking a Question

Please *search* for the previous questions. You can search all issues including
closed ones in GitHub. Also, try Google search as well. Often time, you will be
able to find the answer easily from Google. Create an issue only when you cannot
find any relevant questions. We will deduct point(s) if you create a duplicated
issue.
